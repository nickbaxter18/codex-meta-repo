# Blazing-fast, asynchronous MCP server for seamless filesystem operations. MCP Server

The Rust MCP Filesystem is a high-performance, asynchronous, and lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built in Rust for secure and efficient filesystem operations. Designed with security in mind, it operates in read-only mode by default and restricts clients from updating allowed directories via MCP Roots unless explicitly enabled, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access. Leveraging asynchronous I/O, it delivers blazingly fast performance with a minimal resource footprint.
Optimized for token efficiency, the Rust MCP Filesystem enables large language models (LLMs) to precisely target searches and edits within specific sections of large files and restrict operations by file size range, making it ideal for efficient file exploration, automation, and system integration.

## Tools Details

#### Tool: **`calculate_directory_size`**
Calculates the total size of a directory specified by `root_path`.It recursively searches for files and sums their sizes. The result can be returned in either a `human-readable` format or as `bytes`, depending on the specified `output_format` argument.Only works within allowed directories.
Parameters|Type|Description
-|-|-
`root_path`|`string`|The root directory path to start the size calculation.
`output_format`|`string` *optional*|Defines the output format, which can be either `human-readable` or `bytes`.

---
#### Tool: **`create_directory`**

#### Tool: **`directory_tree`**
Get a recursive tree view of files and directories as a JSON structure. Each entry includes 'name', 'type' (file/directory), and 'children' for directories. Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). If the 'max_depth' parameter is provided, the traversal will be limited to the specified depth. As a result, the returned directory structure may be incomplete or provide a skewed representation of the full directory tree, since deeper-level files and subdirectories beyond the specified depth will be excluded. The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.
Parameters|Type|Description
